Download this docker image with:
```bash
docker pull docker.csse.rose-hulman.edu/neuroprocessor-group/deca-docker/neuro-simulation-env
```

Start your container for the first time with:
```bash
# <parallel-neuro-simulation repo location> is where you cloned the parallel-neuro-simulation repo
docker run -it -v <parallel-neuro-simulation repo location>:/project --name nsenv docker.csse.rose-hulman.edu/neuroprocessor-group/deca-docker/neuro-simulation-env:latest bash
```
* `--name nsenv` - names this container `nsenv`.
* `-v <parallel-neuro-simulation repo location>:/project` - mounts `<parallel-neuro-simulation repo location>` on your host computer to `/project` in this container.
