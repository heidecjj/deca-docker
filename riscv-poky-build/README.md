# riscv-poky-build

## DEPRECATED
We don't use or maintain this docker image anymore. If you want to build Linux for [`deca`](https://github.com/rhit-neuro/deca), see [`firesim-software-env`](../firesim-software-env/) instead.

## Features
This is the Docker image for building `riscv-poky`.
It takes significant amount of space to build and run the image. Building the
reference version of `riscv-poky` uses around 120 GB disk space while a trimmed
down version only uses around 50 GB. Therefore, we only build it
to extract the rootfs and bbl for use with the Spike simulator.
A built copy is in /resources folder.

## Running for the first time
You must first download `riscv-poky`'s build files:
```bash
# cd into a location with ample disk space (e.g. external hard drive)
git clone https://github.com/heidecjj/riscv-poky.git
# the neurosim branch has the right configuration files for building poky for this project
git checkout neurosim
```
Then you must download this docker image with:
```bash
docker pull rhitdeca/riscv-poky-build
```
Start your container for the first time with:
```bash
# <riscv-poky repo location> is where you cloned the riscv-poky repo
docker run -it -v <riscv-poky repo location>:/riscv-poky --name build-poky rhitdeca/riscv-poky-build:latest bash
```
* `--name build-poky` - names this container `build-poky`.
* `-v <riscv-poky repo location>:/riscv-poky` - mounts `<riscv-poky repo location>` on your host computer to `/riscv-poky` in this container.

### Building `riscv-poky` in this container
If you need to add any programs to the `riscv-poky`, you will need to re-build
`riscv-poky`. If you keep all the files produced while building `riscv-poky`,
subsequent builds will take much less time than the original build.

It is best to build `riscv-poky` as a non-root user. If your bash terminal shows `root@<numbers>` instead of `riscv_poky_user@<numbers>` then run:
```bash
su riscv_poky_user
```
Then to start building `riscv-poky` run the following commands:
```bash
cd /riscv-poky
source oe-init-build-env
# the above command should move you into the build dir
bitbake core-image-riscv
```
Note: I had problems with bitbake not being able to start when the hard drive I built
`riscv-poky` on was formatted with exFAT. Reformatting this drive to ext4 fixed my problems.

When `riscv-poky` finishes building, you can find the rootfs and bbl at:
```
ROOTFS: /riscv-poky/build/tmp/deploy/images/riscv64/core-image-riscv-riscv64-<build date and time>.rootfs.ext2
BBL: /riscv-poky/build/tmp/work/riscv64-poky-linux/riscv-pk/1.0-r0/build/bbl
```

## Running subsequent times
See [`README.md`](../README.md#running-containers-subsequent-times) in this directory's parent directory.

## Building
To build this image, run the following command:
```bash
# cd into this folder first
# Make sure to replace <version> with your version number for the image you're building
docker build . -t rhitdeca/riscv-poky-build:<version>
```
